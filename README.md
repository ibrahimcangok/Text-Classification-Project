In this project, the aim is to automatically classify customer support requests. The text data has been processed using TF-IDF vectorization, and the most important features have been selected. The model has been trained and tested with a Random Forest classifier. The model's accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification report have been evaluated. Word clouds have been created for each label to visualize the prominent words. This study aims to increase efficiency by enabling faster and more accurate labeling in customer support processes. Excel files have not been included in the project files due to data confidentiality; you can run the codes with your own datasets.
