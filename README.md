This project aims to automatically classify customer support requests. The text data has been processed using TF-IDF vectorization, and the most important features have been selected. The model has been trained and tested using a Random Forest classifier. The model's performance has been evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Word clouds have been created for each label to visualize the prominent words. This study aims to increase efficiency by enabling faster and more accurate labeling in customer support processes. Due to data confidentiality, Excel files have not been included in the project files; you can modify the code to run with your own datasets.
